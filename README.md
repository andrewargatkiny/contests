# Contests

In this repo I will be uploading my solutions for some of ML & DS contests and championships that didn't lead to some specific research worth a distinct repo but nonetheless were interesting and engaging for me.

## 1) [Yandex ML Cup 2021 (Recsys)](./Yandex%20ML%20Cup%202021%20(Recsys)/)

A contest to build restaraunts' recommender system for tourists given their preferences in home cities.

## 2) [Yandex Cup 2021 Data Science & Analytics](Yandex%20Cup2021%20Data%20Science%20&%20Analytics/)

## 3) [MIPT & Rucode.net AI Festival entry challenge](MIPT%20&%20Rucode.net%20AI%20Festival%20entry%20challenge/)

I uploaded solution for only 1 of 15 tasks: to classify the images from realty web-site using transfer-learning.

This is not an exhaustive list and it will be extended later.
