# Kaggle Inclass Friends Dialogues Classification Challenge

I won $1^{st}$ place. The task was to learn to classify which character of "Friends" TV series a line of dialogue belongs to given scripts automatically translated to Russian.

I used BERT model pretrained on Russian language with some tricks. More info in repo.
